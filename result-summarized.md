The west coast of Japan was struck by a 7.6 magnitude earthquake on January 1, 2024, causing hundreds of buildings to be destroyed and the death toll at 64. The Noto Peninsula on the coast of the Kanazawa Prefecture was the worst affected area, with at least 15 people dead in Wajima city. The Noto airport was the most affected, with all flights cancelled. The UK Foreign Office has advised against travelling to Japan at this time due to the potential for further aftershocks and disruption to transport links. Travel insurance often includes cancellation cover in the event of a natural disaster. Japan accounts for 20% of earthquakes with a magnitude of 6 or more, as it sits on top of the meeting of four tectonic plate boundaries.
